/// Defines node-level resource management and scheduling behavior.

/// A `NodeManager` decides whether a bundle can be accepted by a node,
/// how long it must be retained before retransmission, whether candidate
/// transmissions are feasible, and how node resources are updated once a
/// routing decision is committed.
///
/// # Expected guarantees
///
/// Implementations are expected to keep the dry-run and commit methods coherent:
///
/// - If `dry_run_retention(..., transmission, next)` returns `true`, then
///   `dry_run_multi(..., &[(transmission, next)])` should also accept the same
///   transmission, assuming the other parameters are identical.
/// - If `dry_run_multi(...)` accepts a set of transmissions, then `commit(...)`
///   with the same parameters should succeed.
/// - `delay(...)` should not return a date earlier than the reception end time.
///
/// Violating these guarantees can lead to incorrect routing behavior or panics,
/// but should not cause memory unsafety.
///
/// # Simulation methods
///
/// - `accept(bundle, time, sender)` checks whether the node can receive the bundle.
/// - `delay(bundle, reception, sender, next_vertex)` returns the earliest
///   retransmission time.
/// - `dry_run_retention(bundle, reception, sender, transmission, next_vertex)`
///   checks whether one candidate retention/transmission is feasible.
/// - `dry_run_multi(bundle, reception, sender, transmissions)` checks how many
///   candidate transmissions can be accepted.
///
/// # Commit method
///
/// - `commit(bundle, reception, sender, transmissions)` updates node resources
///   after a routing decision has been accepted.
